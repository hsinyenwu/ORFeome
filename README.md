Ribo-seq analysis for Arabidopsis 7-day old seedlings  
A1. Identification of minimum uORFs with CiPS    
A2: Identification of other uORFs with CiPS  
B. Identification of uORFs that overlap with each other  
C. Identification of uORFs that are regulated by alternative splicing in our experimental conditions
