A. Ribo-seq analysis for Arabidopsis 7-day old seedlings  
B1. Identification of minimum uORFs with CiPS    
B2: Identification of other uORFs with CiPS  
C. Identification of uORFs that overlap with each other  
D. Identification of uORFs that are regulated by alternative splicing in our experimental conditions
