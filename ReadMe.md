Here are the R code for analyzing the Ribo-seq, RiboTaper and dual-luciferase assay results.   
A. RiboTaper for Arabidopsis 7-day old seedling data (including Bowtie2, Stringtie, gffcompare, STAR/RSEM/RiboTaper steps and associated R code for analysis)
B1. Identification of minimum uORFs with CiPS    
B2: Identification of other uORFs with CiPS  
C. Identification of uORFs that overlap with each other   
D. Identification of uORFs that are regulated by alternative splicing in our experimental conditions  
E. Cumulative plot and multiple comparison Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov test   
F. Box plot and Wilcoxon rank-sum test  

The gtf and other files required for this analysis is available [Here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/89j7snbm2r/draft?a=7b3a1001-2727-4a31-8ae5-784337dcc582)
